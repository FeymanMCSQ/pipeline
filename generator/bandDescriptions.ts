ELO 200 — Pre-Wood (Micro-Intuition)
- One-bit questions (Yes/No, This/That).
- Ultra-guided, extremely short.
- Recognition only.
- Heavy scaffolding, picture-friendly.

ELO 300 — Bridge Tier
- Tiny MCQs, vocabulary-focused.
- Recognise simple structures.
- Light scaffolding, definition recall.
  `,

  '300_400': `
ELO 300–400 — Transition into Wood
- Basic MCQs, small conceptual steps.
- Definitions, simple statements.
- Still guided but starting formal structure.

ELO 400 — Wood Tier
- Short, low-friction MCQs.
- Identify theorem names or factual statements.
- This is the entry point to the main ladder.
  `,
